              <p class="lead" id="customLead"> In the years following WW2, one of the last working farms in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was purchased by the federal government in order honour a commitment to returning veterans to provide desperately needed subsidised housing. The families that populated Benny Farm’s xx units became a tight-knit community within NDG neighborhood for over a generation. In the early 1990s, an aging population of veterans, decaying buildings and climbing urban property values led Benny Farm’s landlord, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation proposed moving the veterans to new buildings and selling the site to private developers. This touched off a community mobilisation not only to protect the venerable veterans’ housing complex but to re-imagine it as a new model for ecological and inclusive social housing. These are the stories of some of the people most directly involved in the decade long citizen-led transformation of Benny Farm. </p>

He later became the NDG Community Council’s community organiser for Benny Farm, working directly with the CCNDG’s Housing Committee. Hughes was a spokesman for the community-based response to the CMHC’s proposed plan to demolish Benny Farm and sell most of the land to developers. He worked actively on proposals to preserve low-cost housing at Benny Farm during the redevelopment and has remained involved with affordable housing initiatives in NDG.

          <p class="playerBioR ">Helen Bolton Guy comes from a military family and chose a career in the Canadian Armed Forces. It was her military service that made her family eligible for an apartment at Benny Farm in 1965. With a soldierly sense of order, the tenants coordinated themselves by building and Bolton Guy was her building “Captain,” organising sports and social events and looking out for her neighbours. By 1972, Bolton Guy was head of the Benny Farm Tenants’ Association, advocating for tenants’ rights with The Farm’s landlord, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). She was a leading voice for veterans and Benny Farm tenants rights during the redevelopment and continues to be an organiser and advocate at Benny Farm and in the community.</p>

          <p class="playerBioR ">Born into a family of union organisers and social justice advocates, Sam Boskey was an early activist and community organiser who became a founding member of the progressive municipal party, the MCM (Montreal Citizens’ Movement). He was elected city councilor for the Décarie district from 1982 to 1998, first under the banner of the MCM and later as an independent. During his years in office and after, affordable housing and tenants’ rights were among his top priorities. Boskey’s involvement with Benny Farm began in the late 1980s, when the NDG Community Council’s Housing Committee became concerned about aging veterans in walk-up apartments, and continued through the years of its redevelopment. </p>
